# ExamSecure Prototype

Welcome to the ExamSecure Prototype, a web application designed to showcase a simple implementation of RSA encryption for securing examination questions. This prototype offers a user-friendly interface for encrypting and decrypting questions, a history feature, and a feedback chatbox.

## Features

- **RSA Encryption:** Utilizes the RSA algorithm for secure question encryption and decryption.
- **Live Preview:** Provides a real-time preview of the input as users type.
- **Sidebar History:** Displays a history of encrypted questions for reference.
- **MathJax Integration:** Renders mathematical equations using LaTeX syntax for enhanced display.
- **Chatbox Feedback:** Allows users to provide feedback through an integrated chatbox.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensures a consistent user experience across different devices.

## Usage

1. **Encrypt Questions:**
   - Enter questions in the "Encrypt" section's textarea.
